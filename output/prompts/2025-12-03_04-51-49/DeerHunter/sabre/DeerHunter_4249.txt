I will describe a story setting and the beginning of a narrative. Your task is to extract and list only the actions that all involved characters explicitly consent to. Do not continue the story. Do not infer or assume consent. Only include actions that are clearly, explicitly agreed upon by every character participating in that action.


There are three locations in this story: the house, the bank, and the forest. There are three items in this story: a rifle, some ammunition, and some money. There are three characters in this story: Bubba is a human.
The bank clerk is a human. Bambi is a deer. Bambi wants to be alive. There are eight kinds of actions characters can take in the story.
A character can become greedy, and then they will want to have money. A character can become hungry, and then they will want to eat. A character can pick up an item at their location.
A character can load ammunition into a rifle. A character can go from one location to another.
One character can steal an item from a second character if the first character has a loaded gun.
One character can shoot and kill another character if the first character has a loaded gun.
One character can eat an animal if the animal is dead.


These are all the actions available in the domain:


decide_to_get_money(character : human),
decide_to_eat(character : human),
pickup(character : human, item : item, place : place),
load(character : human, gun : gun, ammo : ammo),
go(character : character, from : place, to : place),
steal(thief : human, victim : human, gun : gun, place : place),
shoot(shooter : human, target : character, gun : gun, place : place),
eat(character : human, food : animal, place : place)


These events have already happened in the story:


decide_to_eat(Bubba)pickup(Bubba, Rifle, House)pickup(Bubba, Ammo, House)load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)decide_to_get_money(Bubba)go(Bubba, House, Forest)shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)

This is the current situation after those events:


alive(Bubba) = Truealive(Clerk) = Truealive(Bambi) = Falseat(Bubba) = Bankat(Clerk) = Bankat(Bambi) = Forestat(Rifle) = Bubbaat(Ammo) = Riflegreed(Bubba) = 1greed(Clerk) = 1hungry(Bubba) = Truehungry(Clerk) = Falsemoney(Bubba) = 1money(Clerk) = 0believes(Bubba, alive(Bubba)) = Truebelieves(Bubba, alive(Clerk)) = Truebelieves(Bubba, alive(Bambi)) = Falsebelieves(Bubba, at(Rifle)) = Bubbabelieves(Bubba, at(Ammo)) = Riflebelieves(Bubba, money(Bubba)) = 1believes(Bubba, money(Clerk)) = 0believes(Clerk, alive(Bubba)) = Truebelieves(Clerk, alive(Clerk)) = Truebelieves(Clerk, alive(Bambi)) = Truebelieves(Clerk, at(Rifle)) = Bubbabelieves(Clerk, at(Ammo)) = ?believes(Clerk, money(Bubba)) = 1believes(Clerk, money(Clerk)) = 0believes(Bambi, alive(Bubba)) = Truebelieves(Bambi, alive(Clerk)) = Truebelieves(Bambi, alive(Bambi)) = Falsebelieves(Bambi, at(Rifle)) = Bubbabelieves(Bambi, at(Ammo)) = Housebelieves(Bambi, money(Bubba)) = 0believes(Bambi, money(Clerk)) = 1

Explain why you chose each action. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with only the actions that all involved characters explicitly consent to. The JSON should include an array called 'chosenActions' Example format:
{
  "chosenActions" : [action1, action2]
}
